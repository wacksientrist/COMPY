A compression algorithm with an 70% Compression rate

it works by taking a 4 bit binary segment and running a function to make a simple 3 bit hash. the hash is purposely made easy to dehash and its got 1 value for every input value

however when combined with zip i got it to 6.4% Compression my examples are included
